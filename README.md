# OAuth / OIDC Cubbyhole

Mostly a demo of the work I've been designing at Storj. This demonstrates how to create a client-only secret that can
be used to create a secure cubbyhole that will allow a user to share secret data with a client application, but not the
identity provider (such as an encryption key).
